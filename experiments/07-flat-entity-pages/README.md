# Flat Entity Pages

Building on top of [06-flat-extensions](../06-flat-extensions/README.md), this
experiment switches over to use a single entity page, with all conditional logic
moved to the cards and content themselves. This creates a much flatter structure
with just a single decision point for each extension.
