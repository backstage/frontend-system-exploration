# Base

This experiment is intended as a base for other experiments. It's a mock app set
up using our existing frontend system. The starting point for this was the
example app in `backstage/backstage`, with a lot of content then being removed.

To be able to create accurate comparisons of different approaches, the whole or
parts of [App.tsx](./App.tsx) can be reimplemented in YAML in separate
experiments. The idea is that with both experiments working towards the same
base, it will be easier to contrast and compare them.
